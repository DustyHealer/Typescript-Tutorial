# Core Data Types - 
Number: 1, 10, 100, 2.5
String: 'hi', "hello", `ok`
Boolean: true or false

# Add type checking in javascript files

# Type Inference
Typescript assigns a datatype to the variable based on the value which is assigned the first time. And later we can't give any other data type later on to that variable.
